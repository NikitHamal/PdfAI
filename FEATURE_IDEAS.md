# 20+ New Feature Ideas

Here are over 20 new feature ideas that are practical, possible, and helpful for the app. These ideas are designed to be implementable without requiring external services, accounts, or significant costs.

## Core Chat Functionality

1.  **Chat History Search:** Implement a search bar within the `ConversationsActivity` to allow users to search through their past conversations by keyword.
2.  **Pin Conversations:** Allow users to pin important conversations to the top of the list in `ConversationsActivity`.
3.  **Export Chat:** Add an option to export a single chat conversation to a text file or a shareable format.
4.  **Markdown Rendering:** Render the AI's responses in Markdown, allowing for better formatting of lists, code blocks, and other elements.
5.  **Copy Code Snippets:** Add a "copy" button to code blocks in the AI's responses to make it easy for users to copy code.
6.  **Text-to-Speech:** Add a button to read the AI's responses aloud, improving accessibility.

## User Interface & Experience

7.  **Customizable Themes:** Allow users to choose from a few different color themes in the settings.
8.  **Font Size Adjustment:** Add an option in settings to change the font size of the chat text.
9.  **In-App Feedback:** Add a simple feedback mechanism (e.g., a "thumbs up/down" on each AI message) to collect user feedback on the quality of the AI's responses.
10. **Conversation Summaries:** Automatically generate a short summary for each conversation and display it in the `ConversationsActivity` list.

## Utility & Productivity

11. **Offline Mode:** Allow the app to be used in a limited capacity when offline (e.g., viewing past conversations).
12. **Quick Prompts:** Create a library of pre-defined prompts for common tasks (e.g., "summarize this text," "translate to Spanish," etc.).
13. **Scratchpad:** Add a simple scratchpad or notes section where users can jot down ideas or temporary information.
14. **In-App Browser:** When the AI provides a link, open it in a simple in-app browser instead of leaving the app.

## Advanced Features

15. **Conversation Stats:** Show interesting statistics about the user's conversations, such as the total number of messages, most used models, etc.
16. **System Prompt Customization:** Allow advanced users to define a custom system prompt in the settings to tailor the AI's behavior.
17. **Temperature & Top-P Control:** Expose the "temperature" and "top-p" parameters in the tune settings for more control over the AI's creativity.
18. **Local Model Support (Experimental):** Explore the possibility of integrating a small, lightweight local model that can run on-device for simple tasks when offline.
19. **Plugin System (Internal):** Create a simple internal plugin system to make it easier to add new features and capabilities in the future.
20. **Dynamic Welcome Messages:** Instead of a static welcome message, show a few different suggestions or a "tip of the day" to encourage user engagement.
21. **Chat Bubbles:** Implement chat bubbles (similar to Facebook Messenger) for ongoing conversations, allowing users to quickly access the chat from anywhere on their device.
22. **Gesture Controls:** Add simple gesture controls, such as swiping a message to reply or copy it.
23. **Batch Operations:** In the `ConversationsActivity`, allow users to select multiple conversations and perform batch operations like deleting or exporting them.
24. **Multi-Window Support:** Enable support for multi-window mode on Android, allowing users to use the app alongside other apps.
25. **Task-Specific Modes:** Create different "modes" for the chat, such as a "coding mode" with a different layout and prompts, or a "creative writing mode" with a more inspirational UI.
